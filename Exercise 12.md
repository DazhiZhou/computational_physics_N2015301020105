# Chapter 6 Waves (Problem 6.6)
## Abstract
An important feature of a linear equation is that the sum of two solutions is also a solution. One consequence of this is that wavepackets 
will travel independently of each other. An especially clear way to demonstrate this is to set up a string with an initial profile such 
that there are two Gaussian wavepackets, located at different places on the string. These wavepackets (or components of them) may then 
propagate toward each other and collide.Show that two such wavepackets pass through each other without changing shape or speed.
## Introduction 
Wave is often intuitively understood as referring to a transport of spatial disturbances that are generally not accompanied by a motion of 
the medium occupying this space as a whole. In a wave, the energy of a vibration is moving away from the source in the form of a 
disturbance within the surrounding medium . However, this motion is problematic for a standing wave , where energy is moving in both 
directions equally, or for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, where the concept of medium does not apply and interaction with a target is 
the key to wave detection and practical applications. There are water waves on the ocean surface; gamma waves and light waves emitted by 
the Sun; microwaves used in microwave ovens and in radar equipment; radio waves broadcast by radio stations; and sound waves generated by 
radio receivers, telephone handsets and living creatures (as voices), to mention only a few wave phenomena.

The central equation of wave motion is

The force on the segment i will come from the neighboring segments, i+1(and i-1). The vertical components of these forces will be equal to 
the tension in the string T, multiplied by the sin(theta), where theta is the angle that the string makes with the horizonta. If we assume that the string displacement is small, so that the angles theta_i are also small, we can write the equation of motion of segment i as

To design a program to calculate it, we reduce it as

## Conclusion
Waves caused by two disturbance can propagate independently with each other.The properties of the waves such as shape and velocity remain the same before and after they join togather. They satisfy the linear superposition principle.
