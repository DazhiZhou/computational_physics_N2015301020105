# Problem 3.31
## Abstract
Study the behavior for other types of tables. One interesting possibility is a square table with a circular interior wall located either 
in the center, or slightly off-center. Another possibility is an elliptical table 
## Method 
We consider a problem of a ball moving without friction on a perfect billiard table.Between collisions the velocity is constant so we have
